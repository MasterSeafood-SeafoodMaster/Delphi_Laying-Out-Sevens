This component shows a ms-like card with NO USE OF DLLs.
It's FREEWARE. I'm not responsible for any damage on your
or your user's PCs.

Help is included in the source file. There are methods to
simplify the use of the component. Possibility of showing
decks of various types.

Please send me an email if you include it in an application.

Go to page:

to see games written by me in Delphi, and an application
of the TCard component.
Email me to have the source code.
